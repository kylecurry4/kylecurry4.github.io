    Originally from Sacramento California, I've always had a passion for media arts ever since middle school. I've worked with several different organizations to booster their social media presence such as David Mckinzie Enterprises, NPH USA with Bob Costa and Mike Ditka, and even the Spring Board for success Chicago.

  <p>
    In my time at Boise State University, I recieved my Bachelors in Integrated Media & Strategic with addtional certificates in Content Production and Sports Information & Culture. I was the President on the Men's Rugby team for 3 years while also being a player for 4.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the future, I want to continue my passion for sports and media by finding a job to incorporate both of these passions. I'm excited for what the future holds for me.
